program IdfContextTest: 
    suppose boolean x is true.
    suppose boolean y is true.
    suppose integer b is 5.
    suppose [integer] k of length 5.
    b is 5.
    k[b] is 5.
    k[b] is b.

    when x do:
        increment b.
        stop.
        
    while x and y do:
        stop.

    task Test takes boolean c and gives integer after:
        suppose integer b.
        b is k[1] times k[3].
        give b.
        
    suppose integer c is Test(y).
    stop.
