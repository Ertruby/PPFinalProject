program test:

suppose integer a.

task f takes boolean g, integer i and integer j and gives integer after:
    suppose integer b. btw, this is a comment.
    suppose integer c.
    5 to a.
    10 to b.
    a + b to c.
    
    suppose integer h.
    false to h.
    while h is btw, this is also a comment. false do:
        increment b.
        when (b is greater than 20 and 1 is 1) is true do:
            h is true.
            .
        stop.
    
    when g is true do: btw, this is the 'if'.
        a plus 1 to a.
        a times b to a.
        increment a.
        stop.
    otherwise do:
        nothing.
        stop.
    give a.
    stop.
    
suppose integer x.
stop.
