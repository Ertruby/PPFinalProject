program TypeContext: 
    suppose boolean x is true.
    suppose integer b is 5.
    suppose [integer] k is [1,2,3].
    suppose [boolean] m is [true,x,true].
    
    b is 30.
    x is false.
    k[0] is b minus 8.
    
    when 5 equals 7 do:
        stop.
    
    while x or (b equals 30) do:
        stop.
    
    task Test takes integer g and gives nothing after:
        suppose integer k.
        stop.
    Test(0).
    
    task Test2 takes integer g, boolean l and integer o and gives integer after:
        suppose integer k is g.
        give k.
    suppose integer d is Test2(9,true,5).
