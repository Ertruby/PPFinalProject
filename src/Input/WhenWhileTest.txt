program Test1:
        suppose boolean h is true.
        suppose integer a is 4.
        suppose integer b is 4.
        suppose integer c is 0.
        while h and (a equals b) and c is smaller than 20 do:
            increment c. 
        stop.
        
        suppose boolean y is true.
        when y do:
            y is false.
        stop.
 
        suppose integer x is 0.
        when x is smaller than or equal to 5 do:
            x is x plus 5.
        stop.
        otherwise do:
            x is 2.
        stop. 

    stop.
