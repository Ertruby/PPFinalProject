program Test1:
        suppose [integer] a of length 5.
        suppose integer herman is 5.
        a is [5,-5,herman].
        suppose integer c is H(5).
        task Func takes boolean g, integer i and integer j and gives integer after:
            suppose integer b is 10.
            suppose integer c is i plus j.
            suppose [integer] o is [1,2,3].
            suppose [integer] k.
            a[1] is 5.
            a[1] is c.
            c is a[0] plus b.
            Stuff(5).
            g is false.
            suppose boolean h is true.
            while h do:
                increment b.
                when b is greater than 20 do:
                    h is false.
                stop.
            stop.
            when g equals false do:
                a[2] is a[0] times a[1].
            stop.
            otherwise do:
                a[2] is b.
            stop.
        give c.
        task Stuff takes integer i and gives nothing after:
            a[1] is 9.
        stop.
        task H takes integer i and gives integer after:
            suppose integer n is i plus 1.
        give n.
    stop.
