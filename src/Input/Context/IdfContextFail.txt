program IdfContextTest: 
    b is 5.
    suppose boolean x is true.
    suppose boolean y is true.
    suppose integer b is 5.
    k[b] is 5.
    k[b] is b.
    suppose [integer] k of length 5.
    
    Test(true).
    task Test takes boolean c and gives nothing after:
        suppose integer b.
        b is k[1] times k[3].
        stop.
