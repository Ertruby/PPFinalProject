program Test0:
    suppose integer a is 3.
    task F takes boolean g, integer i and integer j and gives integer after:
        suppose integer b. btw, this is a comment.
        suppose integer c.
        b is 10.
        c is (a plus b) times 5.
        a is 6.
        suppose boolean h.
        g is false.
        h is false.
        while a is greater than b do:
            when (b is greater than 20) and (1 equals 1) do:
                h is true.
                stop.
            stop.
        when g equals false do: btw, this is the 'if'.
            a is a plus 1.
            a is a times b.
            increment a.
            stop.
        otherwise do:
            stop.
    suppose integer ret is a.
    give ret.
    suppose integer x.
    stop.
