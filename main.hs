suppose integer a is 600.

task F takes boolean g, integer i and integer j and gives integer after:
    suppose integer b. btw, this is a comment.
    suppose integer c.
    a is 5.
    b is 10.
    c is a plus b.
    
    suppose integer h.
    h is false.
    while h equals false do:
        increment b.
        when (b equals greater than 20 and 1 equals 1) equals true do:
            h is true.
            .
        .
    
    when g equals true do: btw, this is the 'if'.
        a is a plus 1.
        a is a times b.
        increment a.
        .
    otherwise do:
        nothing.
        .
    give a.
